## Tips & Tricks
Here is a list of tips, tricks and interesting things that we've picked up over that last couple of years.

* When creating a template from a set design it is always a good idea to overlay the design as a blueprint. It allows you to get pixel perfect results, but it is also quicker ðŸ˜‰. Remember to create your `.page` as the same size (or aspect ratio) as the blueprint. You can use the following snippet - just remember to update the `background-image`.

```
.test-background-image {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-image: url('');
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  pointer-events: none;
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```
